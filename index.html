            <p>
                I am a well-presented, determined individual who is confident in succeeding and thriving. 
                Keen to gain experience in a diverse and important industry. I have worked in various roles 
                which involve excellent work ethic and attention to detail. Three ways my friends would describe 
                me are Spontaneous, Ambitious, and Optimistic. I am a very disciplined and respectful person, 
                who takes pride in my work and loves meeting new people, gaining valuable experiences to help 
                me develop as a person.
